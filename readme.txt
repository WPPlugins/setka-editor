A WordPress plugin for beautiful content that converts. The editor you’ve been waiting for to design your posts.

== Description ==

[vimeo https://vimeo.com/213249050]

Well-structured and visually appealing content sells. It is a fact. The time of plain text posts are over. You need your content to reflect your brand, stand out, engage your audience and convert them as soon as possible. **But how do you design high-impact content experiences in a fast, efficient way, without wasting money on developers and designers?**

That is exactly the question we asked ourselves and how **Setka Editor was born**. We wanted to create a robust plugin **accessible to everyone** to create unique post layouts quickly and easily without having to deal with CSS or HTML.

Simply put, Setka Editor is the first WYSIWYG plugin with page builder functionality but with sole focus on making creating regular drool-worthy content as efficient as possible.

= 1. Design engaging content experiences. =

Do you wish you could have that magazine-like layout? Or maybe you would like to create unique sponsored posts that will wow your readers? Setka Editor can make your most elaborate content dreams come true. Every blog can be a new experiment with the form. No coding skills necessary.

>Setka Editor is functional, beautiful, and super-engaging. It’s everything and more I’ve ever dreamt about as a creator of content aimed at millennial audience in an artistically-minded community. At a reasonable price you can suddenly compete with magazines that built their websites with venture capital. I love it!

= 2. Create regular content faster. Customize easier. =

Want to stop messing around with CSS and HTML or wasting hours on designing daily posts from scratch every time with page builders? We get it. Setka Editor will help you save time and focus on the creative tasks.

>My first reaction was WOW! That was exactly what I would want my blog to look like. I already think that I have a professional blog but Setka Editor took my blog design above and beyond anything I could do on my own.

= 3. Enjoy beautiful content on any device. =

You will never have to worry about being mobile-friendly. Setka Editor automatically adapts your post design for mobile and autoscales images. If you would like to further customize it, you can set specific text formats and fonts for desktop, tablet and mobile. Optimize your post load time by choosing not to use background images on mobile. Preview your post instantly to see what they would look like on different devices.

>Great way to get champagne style news layout for the cheap beer budget.

= 4. Perfect partner: Reliable, scalable and secure. =

Feel confident and at ease, knowing that we got you covered. Setka Editor was initially developed for publishers by publishers. We know what problems and frustrations are associated with designing outstanding content on a daily basis. With Setka Editor you won’t have to stress about optimizing load time of your daily posts or something breaking in your sponsored content. We pride ourselves in our code being clean and beautiful and adding new amazing features on a monthly basis.

>Setka has allowed us to seamlessly integrate beautiful, native advertising functionality into our offering for our clients without any changes to existing infrastructure. Resulting in shorter lead times for activation and deployment of campaigns, plugin  allows us to scale our capacity and service more clients.

= About Setka =

Setka’s innovative content management tools were born, tested, and refined at a leading digital media company in Russia, Look At Media, whose web publications boast more than 7 million unique monthly visitors.

Look At Media was founded in 2006 by Alexey Amotov, Vasily Esmanov, Katya Bazilevskaya, Anton Gladkoborodov, and Kirill Ten. It maintains the sites The Village, Look At Me, Wonderzine, and the US-based Hopes&Fears. The company has won over 65 international advertising awards, including Cannes Lions, One Show, New York Festivals, and D&AD.

In 2014 Setka spun off from Look At Media as an independent software company focused on building state-of-the-art tools that make content creation easy, beautiful, and accessible to everyone.

In the past two years, more than 300 brands and 100 editors have used Setka’s publishing products to create award-winning content and advertising experiences including giants like Conde Nast.

In 2016 we decided to take Setka global and launch one of our first products — Setka Editor plugin for WordPress. We have announced it last December as sponsors at the WordCamp US in Philadelphia.
